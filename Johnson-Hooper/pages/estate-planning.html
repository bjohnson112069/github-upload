                            <p class="card--title">WHO NEEDS AN ESTATE PLAN?</p>
                            <p class="card--text">The simple answer is:  anyone over the age of 18.   Yes, really!  We hope for the best for our clients, friends and families, but plan for life's unexpected events.  From the exciting events such as a the birth of a baby or a child leaving for college, to the untimely death of a loved one or the finalizing of a divorce, plans need to be in place to ensure you and your loved ones have the legal authority to handle to all the resulting circumstances.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="card--text">COLLEGE STUDENTS:  If you have a student heading off to college or one already there, you may have learned that once they are 18, your parental rights seem to evaporate.  Speaking from experience as a parent, when dealing with colleges, parents have limited access to their student's financial accounts or medical concerns without the proper documentation.  Some kids are ready to manage these issues on their own and others would prefer to lean on mom or dad for assistance, so give us a call for more information.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="card--text">YOUNG FAMILIES:  By the time we are in our early 20's, most of us have a bank account and perhaps a vehicle, maybe even a spouse, future spouse or children.  If the unthinkable happens,  some pre-planning with a simple estate plan can ensure the proper care of children and administration of any assets. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="card--text">BLENDED FAMILIES:  Having proper planning in place is even more important for blended families. Without the proper documentation, if tragedy strikes, your family will be at the mercy of the state's laws, which may or may not distribute your estate according to your wishes. Some simple planning ahead of time, can ensure that your loved ones are cared for in the way you intend them to be. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="card--text">TRUSTS, PROPERTY AND TAX PLANNING:  Everyone needs a trust, right?  Well, there are pros and cons to having a trust.  Trusts come is many forms serving various purposes.  You may have a trust from a previous estate planning endeavor that is sitting idle or there may be long-standing trusts within your family holding title to assets.  Each individual and family is unique and we will work with you to analyze your situation to draft a solution that works for you now and in the future taking tax considerations into account</p>
