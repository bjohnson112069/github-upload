                <p class="testimonial-sub-quote txt-light-gray-70-opaque">" I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.  I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.  I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun!  I enrolled shortly thereafter.  The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.  Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "</p>

                <p class="testimonial-sub-quote txt-very-dark-gray-blue-70-opaque">" Before joining the bootcamp, Ive never written a line of code.  I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step.  I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.  The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.  They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.  The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding.  It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.  In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience.  It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.  100% recommend! "</p>
